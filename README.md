## Description

First, make sure you've run `npm i -g serverless` and added your [AWS credentials](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/).

Deploying for the first time can take 10-20 minutes since it needs to create the ElasticSearch instance.  
If there's an error, you may get `ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS` the next time you try to deploy.  
Give it a few minutes and then try again.
```
git clone git@github.com:serverless-cqrs/graphql-example.git
cd graphql-example
npm i
serverless deploy
```

Once deployed, navigate to the returned endpoint url and you'll see the graphql playground, where you can run the following queries:
```
mutation {
  addTodo(id: "123", title: "Get Milk")
}
query {
  getById(id: "123") {
    id
    todos {
      title
      completed
    }
  }
}
```
The AWS Free Tier covers most of these services, but running an ElasticSearch instance on AWS can be expensive.  
Make sure to run `serverless remove` once you're done.
